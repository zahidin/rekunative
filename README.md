# RekuNative

Welcome to **RekuNative**! RekuNative is a boilerplate and generator for React Native. It let you focus on your app, instead starting everything from scratch everytime you need to build an app. :)

### Why RekuNative?

- **Let You focus on your app** with best practice inside
- **We use it too for production** in Rekeningku.com, so you can relax your own while we maintained it for you :)
- **We keep it Simple Stupid** but powerful. It's best for any level of developer

### Whats Inside?

- UI with **native-base**
- Routing and Navigation with **react-navigation**
- API call with **axios**
- State Management with **redux** and **redux-promise-middleware**
- GraphQL Client with **apollo-client** (COMING SOON)
- Testing with **detox** or **jest** generator (COMING SOON)

### Configuration

You can set any configuration inside .env file, here are the list that you can set:
- API_URL: port (String)
- USE_REDUX: true/false (boolean)
- USE_GRAPHQL: true/false (boolean)
- MODE: debug/production (String) **debug will activate Redux Logger**

### Installation

Make sure React Native installed on your system, then:

- Install Dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

- Open your emulator and Run project

```
$ react-native run-android 
#or
$ react-native run-ios
```

- **Optionally** you can use our server example to get you quickly getting started. Here is the repository https://github.com/rekeningku/rekunative-server


### Code Structure

We use very simple structure to get started with

```
|-- rekunative
|-- src
    |-- _navigators
    |-- _redux
        |-- actions
        |-- reducers
        |-- middlewares.js
        |-- store.js
    |-- components
    |-- screens
|-- App.js
|-- index.js
```

### Generators (COMING SOON)

**1. Generate a new Screen**

Usage:
```
rekunative make:screen <name> [options]
```

Arguments:

- name: Name of the Screen

Options:

- -t <value>: Template name that you want to use (signin1, signin2, signup1, signup2, forgetpassword, profile1, profile2, profile3, profilesetting, notification, contact, article1, article2, article3, articleview1, articleview2, chat, chatlist, comment, dashboard1, dashboard2, onboarding1, onboarding2, creditcard, gridmenu1, gridmenu2, listmenu, sidemenu, setting, product1, product2, transaction1, transaction2, illustration) 
- -redux-plain: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using plain array data, and plain reducer naming convention, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-promise: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux-promise-middleware, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-thunk: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux thunk, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- --functional: Generate functional Component instead Class

**2. Generate a new Component**

Usage:

```
rekunative make:component <name> [options]
```

Options:

- -t <value>: Template name that you want to use (signin1, signin2, signup1, signup2, forgetpassword, profile1, profile2, profile3, profilesetting, notification, contact, article1, article2, article3, articleview1, articleview2, chat, chatlist, comment, dashboard1, dashboard2, onboarding1, onboarding2, creditcard, gridmenu1, gridmenu2, listmenu, sidemenu, setting, product1, product2, transaction1, transaction2, illustration)
- -redux-plain: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using plain array data, and plain reducer naming convention, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-promise: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux-promise-middleware, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-thunk: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux thunk, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- --functional: Generate functional Component instead Class

**3. Generate a new Redux (action, and reducer)**

Usage:

```
rekunative make:redux <name> [options]
```

Options:

- --action-only: Generate only redux action
- --reducer-only: Generate only redux reducer
- -redux-plain: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using plain array data, and plain reducer naming convention, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-promise: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux-promise-middleware, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**
- -redux-thunk: Generate Redux that consist of action, and reducer that using redux thunk, **this will also make your generated screen is using Redux connect**

### Contribution Guideline

```
|-- rekunative
    |-- template
        |-- components 
|-- src
    |-- _navigators
    |-- screens
        |-- examples
```

We need your help to make some components to make our generator works (U can see the list below). Create your components file inside "rekunative/template/components" folder. To test your component, simply add your working class inside "src/screens/examples" folder, don't forget to add the routing inside the "_navigators/index.js" file.

|   Components | Status  |
|--------------------|:-----:|
| signin1   |   âœ…   |
| signin2 ||
| signup2     |      |
| forgetpassword             |      |
| profile1             |      |
